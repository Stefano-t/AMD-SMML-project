Ridge Regression model from scratch with Hadoop
===============================================
|colab|

This repository contains the project developed for the courses **Algorithms for
massive dataset** and **Statistical methods for machine learning**. The
objective is to implement a Ridge Regression model from scratch in order to
predict the person income in the Kaggle dataset *2013 American Community
Survey*.


The implementation of the machine learning model is based on the `Apache Hadoop
<https://hadoop.apache.org/>`_ framework, focusing on the scalability of the
implementation across multiple clusters.


File ``project.ipynb`` contains the implemented model, while ``report.pdf``
briefly describes the implementation details.
